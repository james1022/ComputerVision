Pancreas caused too much noise.
As a result, I excluded the row that contains annotations on the pancreas and ran the algorithm again.
This resulted in changing many of the min and max distance pairs.
I thought that this was more meaningful.
	Removing the pancreas row reduced the pairwise distances by a great amount 
	(of course, removing any row would reduce the overall cost by a little)
	Also, because the presence/absence of the pancreas tended to differ not depending on the 
	current stage of the surgery but on how much the surgeon zoomed in with the camera
	or the slightly different orientation of organs in different paitents, removing the
	row with the pancreas annotations improved the accuracy of this model.
	But there was one exceptional case: Zooming out usually brought in the pancreas into the frame.
										Zooming out took the pancreas out of the frame.
										And when the surgeons were in the "clip attaching stage",
										they tended to zoom out for a while to capture the overall
										scene and the clip tool approaching the gallbladder and
										zoomed back in to focus on where to apply to clips.
										So during this stage, the absence/presence (somewhat oscillatory)
										of the pancreas does seem to matter, but this stage can be inferred
										by the clip attribute and the clip tool attribute.
										There is more to be lost than to be gained by keeping the pancreas row.

So now, a new set of analyses based on the results I obtained after removing the pancreas row.

Best Overall: video06_04 (0.1303)
Worst Overall: video06_01 (0.3852)
Since both use video06 as the input, analysis will be below at video06

video01: best and worst are about twice the difference
	Best: video05 (0.1939)
		Analysis: not much difference except some parts where video 1 are oscillating are not in video5
	Worst: video06 (0.3848)
		Analysis: not much difference here either but some parts (e.g. attribute 0 from frames 1660-1900)
				  are different for an extended amount of time. Thus the greater distance

video02: 
	Best: video05 (0.1962)
		Analysis: Some difference in minor details (oscillating portions) but most of the main chunks are similar
	Worst: video07 (0.2984)
		Analysis: Some difference in how several attributes overlap with each other at different points in time
				  (e.g. frames 1400 - 1600, 1200 - 1300)

video03:
	Best: video06 (0.1439)
		Analysis: the two videos progress almost identically except for some differences where either one oscillates
	Worst: video05 (0.2842)
		Analysis: Not much difference except for the main chunks (attributes 1 and 2) in frame 820 - 1000

video04:
	Best: video06 (0.1446)
		Analysis: not much difference here either. The two videos progress almost identically. 
		(cf. video06_04 is the absolute best in the series, almost the same distance as this one)
	Worst: video05 (0.3351)
		Analysis: much differences for the main chunky attributes like 1, 2. (frames 1450 - 1950)
				  Otherwise, similar.

video05:
	Best: video01 (0.1956)
		Analysis: Some differences in minor attributes and oscillations.
	Worst: video06 (0.3433)
		Analysis: very differnt in attributes 0, 1, 2, 8 which are the chunky/important ones.
				  More analysis on this on video06_05 analysis.
			  	  (cf. video06_05 is the absolute worst in the series, almost same distance as this one)


video06:
	Best: video04 (0.1303)
		Analysis: Almost identical. But! if we look at the original plottings of the two videos,
				  we can see that they differ greatly on the duration of the retrieval stage.
				  Such differences cannot be captured by DTW. There are minor differences with
				  the clips attribute.
	Worst: video05 (0.3469)
		Analysis: The two videos differ in several chunky attributes: 1, 2, 8
				  If 8 differs between videos, that probably means that they are different surgeons.
				  Most procedures procede almost the same amongst different surgeons except for their
				  clean-up style. Some surgeons like to clean while performing the surgery while
				  some surgeons do all the cleaning in the end. So maybe, we can even just take
				  attribute 8 (water) when trying to figure out if two surgeries were peformed by
				  the same surgeon or at least if the surgeons in the two videos have similar
				  styles with which they perform surgeries.

video07:
	Best: video06 (0.215)
		Analysis: Chunky attributes are quite similar.
	Worst: video05 (0.3519)
		Analysis: Some differences in attribute 9: stylistic difference-->some surgeons place the 
				  retrieval bag even before the gallbladder has been completely removed (video07).
				  Morevover, oscillations in the minor attributes are also different.

In cases where distances relatively huge, we can infer that the surgeons who performed the 
surgeries in the two videos are different. (or if the surgeons were the same, one particular
patient's conditions rendered the surgical procedures to be slightly different: e.g. gallbladder
in videos 06 and 07 was extremely huge and the surgeon had trouble retrieving it outside the patient's body)
For instance, video05_06 is the worst case for video05.
We can see for the water attribute (row 8) that the surgeon in video06 applies water much before 
the retrieval stage and by large amounts while the surgeon in video01 applies water very little
and during almost near the end of the surgery.
